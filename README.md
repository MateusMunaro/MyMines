# MyMines ??

A simple tool to create and manage Minecraft servers using Docker. No complicated setup, no terminal commands - just click and play.

## What is this?

MyMines lets you spin up Minecraft servers on your computer in seconds. Whether you want to play alone or with friends on your local network, this app handles all the Docker stuff behind the scenes.

## Features

- **Create servers** with custom settings (difficulty, version, player limit)
- **Start/Stop servers** with one click
- **Connection info modal** shows you exactly what address to share with friends
- **Manage multiple servers** from a clean interface
- **Works with any Minecraft version** - just type it in

## Requirements

- Windows
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running
- That's it!

## Getting Started

2. Open MyMines
3. Click "Create Server"
4. Fill in the details and hit Create
5. Start your server and grab the connection address

## Playing with Friends

**Same network (LAN)?** Just share the local IP shown in the connection modal.

**Different network?** You'll need to set up port forwarding on your router or use a tunneling service like [Playit.gg](https://playit.gg/) or [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
